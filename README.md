# Malicious-URL-Detection
With the proliferation of the internet and the increasing reliance on online services, the threat of cyber-attacks has become a significant concern for individuals, organizations, and society at large. One of the common methods used by cybercriminals to compromise systems and steal sensitive information is through malicious URLs. These URLs, disguised as legitimate websites, are used to distribute malware, conduct phishing attacks, and launch other malicious activities. Detecting and blocking these malicious URLs in real-time is critical for maintaining cybersecurity and protecting users' data.
Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for detecting malicious URLs due to its ability to learn from large datasets and automatically identify patterns and features that distinguish between benign and malicious URLs. In recent years, there has been significant research and development in the field of malicious URL detection using machine learning techniques, with the aim of developing more accurate and effective detection methods.
In this project, we have trained machine learning models using Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost on a large dataset with over 6 Lakh rows of URLs. The dataset consists of labelled URLs, categorized as safe, defacement, phishing, or malware URLs. Feature extraction techniques have been employed to extract relevant information from the URLs, which are then used to train the models. The trained models can accurately classify URLs into different categories, enabling the detection of potentially malicious URLs in real-time.
We employ various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, and deep neural networks, to evaluate their performance in detecting malicious URLs. We also utilize feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features for effective detection. The developed system is rigorously evaluated on a real-world dataset of URLs to measure its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive assessment of its effectiveness.
The goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate malicious URL detection system that can help organizations and individuals safeguard against cyber threats. By leveraging the power of machine learning and feature extraction techniques, we aim to create a reliable tool that can effectively identify malicious URLs and provide an additional layer of defence against cyber-attacks. The outcomes of this project have the potential to contribute to the field of cybersecurity and enhance the protection of online users' privacy and security.
